# Tiangolo's GitHub Actions Sandbox

This is not useful for you.

It's just a GitHub repo for me to try out stuff and develop GitHub Actions.

Just because I can't do that locally 🤷


Here is the first experiment from a different account!

Second experiment from Camila's account.

Third experiment from Camila's account.

Another experiment.

Aaand another experiment.

And now, for something completely different: another experiment.

Where could my fishy be.

Hey t'mate!

We now have templates woohoo! 🎉

Let's see those logs.

Debug didn't work 😢

No more tmate, let's check those times.

And now let's time Docker 🐋

Docker is a lot faster than building every time. 🎉

Now this uses a Docker tag and everything. Much wow. Such pro. 🐶

Now let's try to debug tmate again 🕵️

And now, for something completely different... let's keep debugging.

More debugging.

Debuggy, debuggy.

Dev, debug, dev, debug.
