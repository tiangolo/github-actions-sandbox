# Tiangolo's GitHub Actions Sandbox

This is not useful for you.

It's just a GitHub repo for me to try out stuff and develop GitHub Actions.

Just because I can't do that locally 🤷


Here is the first experiment from a different account!

Second experiment from Camila's account.

Third experiment from Camila's account.

Another experiment.

Aaand another experiment.

Hey t'mate!

Let's see those logs.

Debug didn't work 😢

No more tmate, let's check those times.

And now let's time Docker 🐋
